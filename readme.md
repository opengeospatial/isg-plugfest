# Interoperable Simulation and Gaming Plugfest

This plugfest will advance geospatial interoperability of systems exchanging 3D content. OGC will work with the Khronos Group and Working Groups in the OGC to advance interoperability of systems using CDB, 3D Tiles, and glTF. The prototyping will advance interoperability for Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination. More information about this project (including the schedule) can be found at the [OGC Portal Page](https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/isg-plugfest)

This GitHub repository capture the issues to be work by the participants of the plugfest.
